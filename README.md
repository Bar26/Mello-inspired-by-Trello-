### About Trello

Trello is a project management app, using Kanban-style boards,allowing you to optimize work delivery across multiple teams and handle even the most complex projects in a single environment.
Each board is composed of lists which contain different tasks. Users can modify the board, move tasks and lists across the board with D&D, label tasks, add attachments, set deadlines and more. Members of the board can witness every change made live. Everything you see in Trello, you will certainly see in Mello! 

### Features

* Create boards, create and move lists and tasks across the board using **D&D. 
* Edit task to the deepest level: cover(color/image), labels, attachments, due date, description, members, checklists. filter members and labels. copy and remove tasks and lists.
* Activity log, background cover for the board. (on side-menu).
* Login authentication, including encrypting user information.

### Technologies

The technnology stack we used is MERN - MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js.
We used webSockets to enable real-time updates for all users. API calls to the backend are done with REST API method.
In addition, we have incorporated third-side libraries, such as React beautiful D&D, Date-picker and more.
the App's layout was made with Sass (functions, mixins, variables).
